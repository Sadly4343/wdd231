                <h2>Information Explained</h2>
                <p>The information contained on this page has a variety of uses including gardening and general
                    knowledge of plants. It is developed and created by many different contributors who are seeking to
                    give valuable information about plants that are throughout the world! This site is intended to allow
                    for quick access of plant information that will be valuable
                    regardless of who might be seeking it.</p>
                <p>Below this will be an explanation of the information pertaining to the plants you chose.</p>
                <p>
                    <strong>pH Balance:</strong> This will typically be useful for gardening and reaching a pH
                    that offers the best ability for growth and improve your plant health. This will be
                    discussed further below.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Edibility:</strong> This will reference whether the plant itself is able to be eaten by
                    humans
                    and does not pertain to the fruit that is with relation to the fruit information. However, many
                    plants
                    are edible and using resources to check for them safely before consuming is always advised. </p>
                <p><strong>Bloom Months:</strong> This indicates the time when the plant is flowering and typically not
                    containing fruit. However, for plants like grains, this is when they will be harvested. The
                    best time to harvest your plants will depend on the type, but generally, weeks or months before
                    bloom
                    months for your plant will be the best time to harvest. This also means the best time to prune and
                    allow for new growth on your plants will be the months they bloom to allow for the most time to have
                    fruitful plants. </p>
                <p><strong>Observations:</strong> Observed locations around the world where the plant has been seen and
                    grown or
                    found in the wild. This can offer valuable information for gardeners seeking to know whether they
                    can grow
                    these plants or for anyone seeking information on if the plants found on this site are around them.

                <h3>Care Guide</h3>
                <p><strong>Light:</strong> Light requirement for the plant is scaled 1-10 with the higher number being
                    more
                    dependent on a light source.</p>
                <p><strong>Plants 1-5:</strong> The plants that are within this section can handle and will ultimately
                    prefer low light conditions with only indirect sunlight and typically shaded most of the day. Good
                    choice for house plants that can be set up away from windows.</p>
                <p><strong>Plants 6-10:</strong> The plants within this section will scale linearly with dependency
                    for sunlight
                    and will typically require moderate to high sunlight with around 4 hours of moderate sunlight
                    per
                    day that scales up to 10-12 hours per day of direct sunlight.</p>
                <p><strong>pH Requirements:</strong> pH is key for plant growth and finding the correct level is
                    critical for plant health.</p>
                <p><strong>Acid Seeking Plants pH 4.5-6.0:</strong> These will be your plants like blueberries and
                    gardenias that do well with acidic soil.</p>
                <p><strong>Neutral Seeking Plants pH 6.0-7.0:</strong> The middle ground plants like tomatoes and roses
                    will be found here and do best. These will generally be a majority of garden-bound plants.</p>
                <p><strong>Alkaline Seeking Plants pH 7.0-8.5:</strong> These will be your highly basic plants that can
                    handle the high levels of alkaline soil like lavender or lilacs.</p>
                <p><strong>How to increase pH:</strong> The quickest and most efficient way to increase pH will be using
                    lime, which can usually be found at your local hardware store, or using wood ash that you can make
                    yourself!</p>
                <p><strong>How to reduce pH:</strong> The best way to lower pH is by using things like sulfur or organic
                    matter you
                    might have around your house, like pine needles!</p>
